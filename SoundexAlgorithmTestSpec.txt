Soundex algorithm Test specification document.

Aim: The aim of this test spec is to verify that the generateSoundex function correctly generates the Soundex code for various types of input.

Test Cases:

1. Test Case Name: ReplaceAlphabetsWithDigitAfterFirstLetter
Scenario: The alphabets are replaced with digits after first letter.
Steps:
Given "Aeiou" as input, then "A000" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
he function should replace the alphabets with digits after first letter.

2. Test Case Name: AppendThreeZerosIfResultContainsLessThanThreeDigits
Scenario: Single character padding
Steps:
Given "N" as input, then "N000 " is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should convert a single alphabet to a digit (based on the lookup table) and pad with zeros until the length reaches 4.


3. Test Case Name: RemoveAllExceptTheFirstLetterAndThreeDigitsAfterIt
Scenario: Lowercase Conversion and Limit to four digits
Steps:
Given "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" as input, then "A123" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase. Only the first 4 letters should be considered; the rest should be ignored.

4. Test Case Name: UppercasesFirstLetterAndReplaceWithDigits
Scenario: Convert to uppercase and replace with digits
Steps:
Given "abcd " as input, then "A123 " is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should .


5. Test Case Name: IgnoresNumbersAndEncodesRemainingCharacters
Scenario: Numbers and Letters
Steps:
Given "17AK" as input, then "1200" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should ignore non-alphabetic characters (numbers) and encode the alphabetic characters according to the Soundex mapping.

6. Test Case Name: ReturnsZerosForDigitOnlyInput
Scenario: Digit-Only Input
Steps:
Given "63619156" as input, then "6000" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should keep the first letter or number as is and return a code consisting of zeros if the input contains only d

7. Test Case Name: IgnoresSpecialCharactersAndDigits
Scenario: Special Characters and Digits
Steps:
Given "q@!18A" as input, then "Q000" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should replace special characters and digits with '0', encoding only alphabetic characters if they are within the length of 4

8. Test Case Name: EncodesFirstCharacterAndIgnoresDuplicates
Scenario: Repitative Letters
Steps:
Given "FFFFF" as input, then "F100" is expected.
Requirement Specifications:
The function should encode the first character and ignore subsequent duplicates, padding the code as zero.
